For about a year and a half I was a full time automotive photographer! After a year and a half of the Covid lockdowns I had a bad case of cabin fever and had been watching my bucket list languish for far too long. I took a sabbatical from engineering to explore the automotive world through a lens. I shot primarily motorsports and events. While I no longer shoot professionally, my old portfolio site is still live.

Some of my favorite projects:

- [Rally photography](https://merriman.photo/gallery/rally/), easily the most difficult motorsport discipline I shot. Days of work, recce-ing, planning out a shot and location list, all to have maybe 6 chances at each car over a two day rally.
- [The Lunatics Run the Asylum at Eagle Field Drags](https://merriman.photo/3472/the-lunatics-run-the-asylum-at-eagle-field-drags/)
- [Keeping it Simple on Hotrod Power Tour](https://merriman.photo/4036/keeping-it-simple-on-hot-rod-power-tour/)
- [TROG Wildwood](https://merriman.photo/portfolio/trog-wildwood/)
